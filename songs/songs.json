        "verse1": "The city bleeds neon, a sickly, pale glow\nReflecting the emptiness, where shadows grow\nMy pulse a dull echo, a rhythmic decay\nAnother night haunted, where demons hold sway\nThe taste of cold metal, a phantom on my tongue\nA silent confession, a battle unsung.",
        "chorus": "The wires are frayed, a sparking, dark mess\nDepression's a black hole, an endless abyss\nPTSD's a wildfire, consuming the mind\nAnxiety's a serpent, its coils tightly entwined\nHeartbreak's a graveyard, where hope lies interred\nA hollow existence, a life unheard.",
        "verse2": "The mirror reflects back, a stranger's cold stare\nEyes hollow and vacant, a burden to bear\nEach breath a sharp razor, slicing through the air\nA constant reminder, of all that's unfair\nThe whispers grow louder, they claw and they bite\nDragging me deeper, into the endless night.",
        "bridge": "There's no salvation, no light to be found\nJust the crushing weight, of hallowed ground\nThe memories fester, a poisoned, dark seed\nPlanting despair, fulfilling a need\nTo sink into nothing, to simply erase\nThe pain of existence, the desolate space.",
        "verse3": "The walls are closing, the air grows so thin\nA suffocating darkness, where shadows begin\nTo dance and to mock me, with cruel, twisted glee\nA symphony of madness, eternally free\nThe weight of the world, a crushing embrace\nLeaving me broken, without a trace.",
        "outro": "No light, no escape, just the endless descent\nA final surrender, where life is misspent.\nA silent departure, a fading away\nLost in the darkness, where shadows hold sway."
